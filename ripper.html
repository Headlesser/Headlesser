							<h1 class="major">The Ripper</h1>
							<p><b>The Ripper</b> was my first attempt at creating a short game experience from start to finish. I view the project as a good personal experience
							in self-motivation and exercising of my technical design and playtest analysis skills.</p>
							<p>Project began in April 2018 and was finished in one month. It is currently available to play for free in browser.</p>
							<p><b>My contribution to The Ripper:</b></p>
								<ul>
								<li>Managed self-motivating schedule and tasks without missing deadlines</li>
								<li>Familiarized self with multiple pipelines to determine common pitfall areas to avoid in future projects</li>
								<li>Designed array-based dialogue system, diegetic UI and layered musical track</li>
								<li>Created all art assets, sound & music, and dialogue</li>
								</ul>
								<ul class="actions">

							<p><b>One of the features I am most proud</b> of designing the diegetic UI and the layered musical track. Some design difficulties I ran into after receiving negative player feedback was how to
							display held clues to the player and how to provide a sense of progression, which players said was very unclear. I solved these problems by designing a diegetic UI and layered music track to add more instruments with each clue found.</p>
							<p>Originally, my first prototype included a basic one-track theme and had no inventory. While this worked, I found that this setup neglected giving enough progression feedback
							to the player. To fix this, I first split up the soundtrack into multiple instrumental tracks which could be layered
							on top of one another. Additionally, I simply had it so the player's currently held 'clue' or item appears in their hand on screen so they could see 
							what section of the puzzle they were on.
							This created a situation where the player could audibly hear their progression-- that is, with each clue found, the soundtrack becomes more complex until the entire song has been 'revealed',
							thus creating something akin to a 'theme-song' that plays whenever the player has successfully completed a task. The diegetic UI cut down on having to created
							an extensive amount of menu assets and also made it clearer to the player what items they had on their person at any given time.</p>
