											<h2>Passwords, Please</h2>

										<p>A 3D puzzle game created for the IT Training Program at Indiana University to educate players on password security and identifying common phishing techniques. Join Wolfrid, a sheep-cosplaying wolf and cyber-criminal-extraordinaire, on his heist to crack a safe belonging to an unfortunate individual with poor personal security habits.</p>

										<p>Passwords, Please is a small project created with the intent of providing a means for students and staff at Indiana University to partake in a digitized rendition of an escape-room workshop previously designed to inform participants about common phishing tactics. As part of the internship I was requested to produce a game that could be used in tandem with these workshops and potentially employed as part of an initiative to deliver similar content to students and staff in a new and enjoyable way.</p>

											<h2>Contributions</h2>
										</header>
									<ul>
										<li>Designed puzzles and wrote dialogue that are both educational 
										<ul>
											<li>Incorporated more humorous elements broadened our options when it came to how to portray educational content and prevented the puzzles from feeling too similar or duplicated.</li>
											<li>Gave game dialogue more substance and invoked greater interest among players more than just lecturing definitions.</li>
											<li>Made the project feel less like a dry presentation and more like an interactive learning experience.</li>
										</ul>
									</ul>
										
									<li>Conducted regular communications with contractors to provide consulting and regular updates on progress so the project was completed with the requested goals and requirements</li>
									<li>Managed weekly in-person and remote task distribution and team meetings to keep development going smoothly</li>
									<li><a href="https://github.com/Headlesser/PasswordsPleasev2/wiki">Organized and updated clear documentation, which can be found here</a></li>

							<li>Creating a method to design and implement puzzles in a way that emphasized the educational experience
								<ul>
									<li>Project was initially designed as a first-person platformer</li>
									<li>Focus put on player manipulating environment to access new areas</li>
									<li>Playtest analysis showed players losing sign of game's intended educational purpose</li>
									<li>Players would hyper focus on clicking every irrelevant object or how to move around the world instead of the educational content</li>
									<li>Contractors wanted some way of directly informing the player about certain topics/actions</li>
								</ul>
							</ul>
							<ul>
							<li>Process:</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Parsed through player feedback to determine what aspects of gameplay were most irrelevant (keyboard movement, jumping)</li>
									<li>Suggested to pivot away from a first-person platformer in favor of a point-and-click structure</li>
									<li>Created a completely new prototype following this suggestion where clicking was the player's only means of moving/interacting</li>
									<li>Used the topic of security questions as a way to modularly separate puzzles by allowing players to solve puzzles in any order they choose</li>
									<li>Created a narrative system with monologue-style dialogue to provide written explanation of lessons directly to player</li>
								</ul>
							</ul>	
							<ul>
							<li>Results:</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Players responded positively to simpler controls and spend less time idling</li>
									<li>Point-and-click structure paired extremely well with our lock-and-key/'sandwich layer' puzzle design</li>
									<li>Provided some greatly needed constraints on level and puzzle design in that there is only one room with a singular input action (clicking)</li>
									<li>Helped bring player focus back onto the educational message of the puzzles themselves rather than distracting mechanics or controls</li>
								</ul>
