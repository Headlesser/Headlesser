											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I am a game designer with an understanding of scripting and art that allows me to communicate and work efficiently with people of many different professions. I constantly seek out the wisdom of smart and creative people to strengthen my skills and expand my knowledge on all aspects of game development and project management. </p>
										
										<p>For me, games have always been an artform of exploring my love for puzzles and learning new things. From the early days of borrowing ClueFinders CDs from the library to drafting my own board games out of old cardboard boxes and half-dead sharpie markers, I am passionate about solving problems and seeking out opportunities to teach others and give them something new to think about through my creative efforts. If I am not making art or working closely with my team, I am always playing and solving puzzles one way or another.</p>
										
										
										<p>I am an active player of Magic: The Gathering, often drafting up new Commander decks and looking intently for cards that I have never seen or played before to surprise my friends and bring something new to the table. I am also passionate about writing stories and designing characters. Compiling notes and fitting plot points together like a literary jigsaw composed of people and places and magic are some of the most uplifting puzzles I enjoy. If I am not solving problems or writing chapters, I am often watching documentaries spanning from the discovery of Absolute zero to the deciphering of ancient Mayan hieroglyphics.</p>
