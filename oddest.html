							<p><b>OddestSea</b> is currently being developed by a team of 11 members. My primary role on the team is as the technical director, but includes
							other areas of design and programming. Some of my work includes prototyping and scripting mechanics in accordance with the core vision,
							detecting design flaws and making adjustments, and helping team members to communicate ideas and concerns with one another.</p>
							<p>Project began in August 2018 and is currently in ongoing development. Game has an expected release in March 2020.</p>
							<p><b>My contribution to OddestSea:</b></p>
								<ul style="display:table;">
									<li>Designed and implemented satisfying boat and camera movement</li> 
										<ul>
											<li>Proved to be an ongoing problem throughout development</li> 
											<li>Frequent iteration after repeated collection of playtest data</li>
											<li>Finished with a much smoother and enjoyable experience</li>
										</ul>
									<li><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/oddestseagame/devblog?authuser=0">Managed disputes and facilitated clear communications between design and programming teams, of which a write-up can be found here</a></li>
										<ul>
											<li>Miscommunication often caused serious problems in regards to task descriptions</li>
											<li>Lack of understanding led to misconceptions about expected deliverables and created a strained, unfriendly atmosphere</li>
											<li>Assisting team members in voicing their confusion with tasks or tools helped relieve personal tensions and clarify sprint goals</li>
										</ul>
									<li><a href="https://github.com/rockretep/oddestsea/wiki">Organized and updated coherent design documentation which can be viewed here</a></li>

							<p><b>One of the problems we had during development was</b> solidifying our core vision for the game. Players were vocal that sailing was not fun and there were not enough points of interest or choices to keep their attention for very long. To solve this problem, we iterated upon our level design and moved away from the idea of a wide-open map with multiple goals in favor of a more populated obstacle course-like layout with the goal at the center of the map. We also iterated on the behavior of monsters and made them more telegraphed so the player could understand their movements.</p>
							<p>This created the core experience of 'being pursued' that we wanted to accomplish, where the player wasn't completely lost sailing around with little to no direction, and also provided players with a feeling of anxiety when, say, a monster is patrolling around the corner and they must slip past at the correct moment to continue without being see, or else risk being chased down.</p>
