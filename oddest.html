							<p><b>OddestSea</b> was developed by a team of 12 members. My primary role on the team is as the technical director, but also includes
							other areas of design and programming. Some of my work includes crafting elements and mechanics in accordance to the game vision and core themes,
							detecting design flaws and making adjustments, and mentoring other team members on their technical understanding and advising design on the fesability of certain ideas.</p>
							<p>Project began in August 2018 and is currently in ongoing development. Game has an expected release on Steam Spring 2020.</p>
							<p><b>My contribution to OddestSea:</b></p>
								<ul style="display:table;">
									<li>Collaborating closely with all members of the development pipeline to discuss and review content, sprint plans, and cultivate a healthy team environment</li>
									<li>Evaluating ideas from all members through the creative process to provide honest feedback and make difficult decisions.</li>
									<li>Developing demos and iterating on gameplay features; sailing movement, cameras, enemy AI, etc.</li>
									<li>Designing many aspects of the game including gameplay, systems, thematics, etc.</li>
									<li>Organizing clear design documentation and vision to all members of the team.</li>
								</ul>
										<!--pivot towards a fast-paced obstacle course design. Originally, the game was a slower exploration-based game
									where the player would fight monsters with various weapons and sail to shipwrecks and collect lost souls to light various lighthouses around the map. Once all of them were lit, the player won the game.
									After discussing with the programming and design teams, this design proved to be incredibly over-scoped for our team, perplexed players with confusing 'soul' mechanics, added unnecessarily complex control schemes, and did not
									accurately portray our core vision of 'being pursued'. Currently, the game is now designed as a deadly obstacle course with the goal at the center of the map. The player must avoid and outrun monsters and other
									obstacles without dying. The only safe-spots are lit buoys scattered throughout the sea, which produce a guiding light that frightens monsters away and provide a place where the player can rest.
									<p>By making the decision to pivot towards the current design, this created a clearer sense of tension and better highlighted the design pillar of 'light versus dark'

							<p><b>One of the features I am most proud</b> of working on is the atmospheric design of 'a person being pursued', which both enhances the sailing experience beyond simply moving from landmark to landmark,
									as well as provides the player with unobtrusive feedback that keeps the experience free of elements that may distract from the strong and enriching atmosphere of the game.
									Originally, we had begun production with UI (health bar, compass, etc) that would be present on the game screen, as well as various mechanics (flare gun, combat, etc) that would require the
									player to multitask between sailing and other actions. We found this design to be debilitating early on, as players and critics frequently complained about the controls when it came to switching between
									sailing and other tools, as well as the UI in that it distracted from the engaging dark atmosphere of the game.</p>
							<p>Gradually we made changes to this system, first by removing any on-screen
									graphics in favor of a diegetic UI design, and then any 'tool' mechanics
									that required the player to do something other than sail, and replaced them with obstacles or areas of interest that could be interacted with simply by sailing to them. This change served
									to help expand upon the atmosphere of the game as our design now hinged on creating mechanics that enhanced the act of sailing itself rather than cluttering it. Additionally, this helped
									reduce the scope of the project significantly.</p>

		During the game, the player's
									one and only ability is to sail-- or move. The player has no weapons or attacks to combat monsters or obstacles and can only depend on their sailing skills to survive.
									As such, to keep the main focus on sailing ability and providing the player with different ways they can sail, all obstacles and 'tools' within the game can only be used
									by sailing into/around them. For example, within the game the player can encounter various natural phenomena: seaweed, wind and flash mist. Flash mist is a bright ball of light that the player
									can sail into and cause it to grow, creating a blinding flash that stuns any pursuing monsters. Sailing into wind provides the player with a boost of speed, and sailing into seaweed slows the boat down.</p>
							<p>This created an emphasis on sailing skills and decisions rather than cluttering the control scheme with confusing external tools. This emphasized more twitch-based decision making and created
									a situation where the player could always feel the tension of being pursued while also having some sort of agency in how they decided to sail. This design
									maintained the fast-paced nature of the game rather than bogging it down with unnecessary complexity that distracted from the feelings we wanted to instil.
