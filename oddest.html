								<li><b>Skills Acquired</b></li>
									<ul>
										<li>Developing a game from conception to release (August 2018 - March 2020)</li>
										<li>Working with a large team (11) with multiple disciplines and personalities</li>
										<li>Designing, testing, and refining systems and gameplay</li>
										<li>Utilizing SCRUM/Agile workflows in a professional setting</li>
									</ul>

							<p><b>My contributions to OddestSea:</b></p>
								<ul style="display:table;">
									<li>Collaborated with designers to create monster and environmental interactions</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Early monster behaviors were too ambitious and I worked with the development team to re-evaluate monster designs by considering what was possible given player feedback and team resources</li>
											<li>Iterated upon shark behavior to create simple, choreographed movement and attacks that players could consciously predict</li>
											<li>Created wind, seaweed, and buoy interactions to enhance/hinder sailing and provide short-term goals</li> 
											<li>Gave players greater control and more choices when encountering monsters or other obstacles</li>
										</ul>

							</div>
							
									<li><a href="https://www.oddestsea.com/devblog">Managed disputes and facilitated clear communications between programming and other teams, of which a write-up can be found here</a></li>
										<ul>
											<li>Lack of communication caused problems with understanding tasks, progress and expected deliverables</li>
											<li>Assisted team members in understanding technical problems and constraints helped reduce confusion and clarify project goals</li>
										</ul>
									<li>Worked in other areas as needed</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Designed and implemented satisfying boat and camera movement</li>
											<li>Worked as the technical director, managed and evaluated programming tasks to communicate problems back to the design team and producers</li>
											<li>Provided critical feedback to artists and other designers to optimize visual aesthetic and gameplay</li>
											<li>Helped team members debug problems in engine and discuss possible causes and solutions</li>
											<li><a href="https://github.com/Headlesser/oddestdocumentation">Organized design documentation which can be viewed here</a></li>

						<ul style="display:table;">
							<li>Helped the team overcome problems we had with iterating on player feedback and cutting content</li> 
								<ul>
									<li>Sailing was not fun, controls were confusing</li>
									<li>Not enough points of interest or choices to keep player attention for very long</li>
									<li>Combat system was a constant problem, felt clunky, extraneous, and distracted from the strong visuals</li>
									<li>Team had trouble figuring out what was feasible given available resources</li>
								</ul>
							<ul>
							<li>Process:</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Evaluated available time and other tasks to determine what was out of scope</li>
									<li>Engaged in group decision making with producer, design, and programming teams at weekly meetings to discuss content cuts</li>
									<li>Referred back to our core vision to cut systems that did not fit (combat)</li>
									<li>Collaborated on level design and moved away from wide-open map to obstacle course layout with the final goal at the center (lighthouse)</li>
									<li>Thoroughly described problems with boat movement that both designers and programmers could understand and act on</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Results:</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Better represented the experience of 'being pursued' we wanted to accomplish</li>
									<li>Player was not completely lost sailing without any direction</li>
									<li>Put greater emphasis on our strong visual aesthetic</li>
									<li>More enjoyable and smooth boat movement/sailing</li>
									<li>Reduced overall scope</li>
