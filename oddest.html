							<p><b>OddestSea</b> was developed by a team of 13 members. My primary role on the team is as the technical director, but also includes
							other areas of design and programming. Some of my work includes crafting and balancing elements and mechanics in accordance to the game vision and core themes, as well
							as detecting design flaws and making adjustments so all aspects of the experience fall in accordance to our core design pillars.</p>
							<p>Project began in August 2018 and is currently in ongoing development. Game has an expected release on Steam Spring 2020.</p>
							<p><b>My contribution to OddestSea:</b></p>
								<ul style="display:table;">
									<li>Collaborating closely with all members of the development pipeline to discuss and review content, sprint plans, and cultivate a healthy team environment</li>
									<li>Evaluating ideas from all members through the creative process to provide honest feedback and make difficult decisions.</li>
									<li>Designing many aspects of the game including gameplay, systems, thematics, etc.</li>
									<li>Working closely with programmers to iterate on gameplay features; sailing movement, cameras, enemy AI, etc.</li>
									<li>Organizing clear design documentation and vision to all members of the team.</li>
								</ul>
										<!--pivot towards a fast-paced obstacle course design. Originally, the game was a slower exploration-based game
									where the player would fight monsters with various weapons and sail to shipwrecks and collect lost souls to light various lighthouses around the map. Once all of them were lit, the player won the game.
									After discussing with the programming and design teams, this design proved to be incredibly over-scoped for our team, perplexed players with confusing 'soul' mechanics, added unnecessarily complex control schemes, and did not
									accurately portray our core vision of 'being pursued'. Currently, the game is now designed as a deadly obstacle course with the goal at the center of the map. The player must avoid and outrun monsters and other
									obstacles without dying. The only safe-spots are lit buoys scattered throughout the sea, which produce a guiding light that frightens monsters away and provide a place where the player can rest.
									<p>By making the decision to pivot towards the current design, this created a clearer sense of tension and better highlighted the design pillar of 'light versus dark'

							<p><b>The features I am most proud</b> of working on is the movement-based mechanics which enhance and keep the act of sailing interesting beyond simply moving from one place to the next. During the game, the player's
									one and only ability is to sail-- or move. The player has no weapons or attacks to combat monsters or obstacles and can only depend on their sailing skills to survive.
									As such, to keep the main focus on sailing ability and providing the player with different ways they can sail, all obstacles and 'tools' within the game can only be used
									by sailing into/around them. For example, within the game the player can encounter various natural phenomena: seaweed, wind and flash mist. Flash mist is a bright ball of light that the player
									can sail into and cause it to grow, creating a blinding flash that stuns any pursuing monsters. Sailing into wind provides the player with a boost of speed, and sailing into seaweed slows the boat down.</p>
							<p>This created an emphasis on sailing skills and decisions rather than cluttering the control scheme with confusing external tools. This emphasized more twitch-based decision making and created
									a situation where the player could always feel the tension of being pursued while also having some sort of agency in how they decided to sail. This design
									maintained the fast-paced nature of the game rather than bogging it down with unnecessary complexity that distracted from the feelings we wanted to instil.
