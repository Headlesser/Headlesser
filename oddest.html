							<p><b>OddestSea</b> is currently being developed by a team of 11 members. My primary role on the team is as a designer, though I also functioned as the technical director by managing weekly programming tasks and communications.</p>
							<p>Project began in August 2018 and is currently in ongoing development. Game has an expected release March 1, 2020.</p>
							<p><b>My contributions to OddestSea:</b></p>
								<ul style="display:table;">
									<li>Designed monster and environmental interactions</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Early monster behaviors were incredibly overscoped and players didn't know what to do</li>
											<li>Took time and abilities of team into consideration to re-evaluate what was possible</li>
											<li>Iterated upon shark and lamprey behaviors with simplified, choreographed movement and attacks</li>
											<li>Created wind, seaweed and buoy interactions to enhance/hinder sailing and provide short-term goals. 
											<li>Finished with 2 completed enemy types</li>
										</ul>
									<li><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/oddestseagame/devblog?authuser=0">Managed disputes and facilitated clear communications between the programming team and other teams, of which a write-up can be found here</a></li>
										<ul>
											<li>Miscommunication often caused serious problems in regards to assigning tasks and how to use project tools</li>
											<li>Lack of understanding led to confusion about expected deliverables due each week</li>
											<li>Assisting team members in voicing their confusion with tasks or tools helped relieve personal tensions and clarify sprint goals</li>
										</ul>
									<li>Assisted in roles outside of design as needed</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Designed and implemented satisfying boat and camera movement</li>
											<li>Worked as a technical director to manage and evaluate programming tasks and communicate problems back to the design team and producer</li>
											<li>Helped team members debug issues and properly use source control</li>
											<li>Provided critical feedback to artists and other designers to optimize visual aesthetic and gameplay.</li>
										</ul>
									<li><a href="https://github.com/rockretep/oddestsea/wiki">Organized and updated coherent design documentation which can be viewed here</a></li>

						<ul style="display:table;">
							<li>One of the problems we had during development was iterating on gameplay and cutting things</li> 
								<ul>
									<li>Sailing was not fun, controls were confusing</li>
									<li>Not enough points of interest or choices to keep player attention for very long</li>
									<li>Combat system was a constant problem, felt clunky, extraneous, and distracted from the strong visuals</li>
									<li>Team had trouble figuring out what was feasible given available resources</li>
								</ul>
							<li>To solve the problem I:</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Evaluated team technical competency, available time, and other tasks to determine what was out of scope</li>
									<li>Communicated cuts with producer, design, and programming teams at weekly meetings</li>
									<li>Moved away from wide-open map with multiple goals, instead helped design obstacle course layout with the final goal at the center of the map (lighthouse)</li>
									<li>Adjusted behavior of monsters to be more telegraphed so the player could understand their movements</li>
									<li>Made boat movement control less like a simulation</li>
								</ul>
						</ul>	
							<p>This created the core experience of 'being pursued' that we wanted to accomplish, where the player wasn't completely lost sailing around with little to no direction, and also provided players with a feeling of anxiety when, say, a monster is patrolling around the corner and they must slip past at the correct moment to continue without being seen, or risk being chased down. Cutting combat proved to be the correct choice as it reduced scope cosiderably and let design focus on simpler interactions.</p>
