							<ul style="display:table;">
								<li><b>Skills Acquired</b></li>
									<ul>
										<li>Gained experience developing a game from conception to release (August 2018 - March 2020)</li>
										<li>Gained experience working with a large team (11) with multiple disciplines and personalities</li>
										<li>Designed, tested, and refined systems and gameplay</li>
										<li>Gained experience using SCRUM/Agile workflows in a professional setting</li>
									</ul>
							</ul>
							<p>Project began in August 2018 and is currently in ongoing development. Game soft released on March 1, 2020 and is <a href="https://oddestsea.itch.io/oddest-sea">available for download on itch.io.</a></p>
							<p><b>My contributions to OddestSea:</b></p>
								<ul style="display:table;">
									<li>Designed monster and environmental interactions</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Early monster behaviors were incredibly overscoped and players didn't know what to do</li>
											<li>Took time and abilities of team into consideration to re-evaluate what was possible</li>
											<li>Iterated upon shark and lamprey behaviors with simplified, choreographed movement and attacks</li>
											<li>Created wind, seaweed and buoy interactions to enhance/hinder sailing and provide short-term goals. 
											<li>Finished with 2 completed enemy types</li>
										</ul>
									<li><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/oddestseagame/devblog?authuser=0">Managed disputes and facilitated clear communications between the programming team and other teams, of which a write-up can be found here</a></li>
										<ul>
											<li>Miscommunication often caused serious problems in regards to assigning tasks and how to use project tools</li>
											<li>Lack of understanding led to confusion about expected deliverables due each week</li>
											<li>Assisting team members in voicing and addressing their confusion helped reduce tension and clarify sprint goals</li>
										</ul>
									<li>Assisted in other areas as needed</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Designed and implemented satisfying boat and camera movement</li>
											<li>Worked as the technical director, managed and evaluated programming tasks to communicate problems back to the design team and producers</li>
											<li>Helped team members debug issues and properly use source control</li>
											<li>Provided critical feedback to artists and other designers to optimize visual aesthetic and gameplay.</li>
											<li>Helped team members debug problems in engine and discuss possible causes and solutions.</li>
										</ul>
									<li><a href="https://github.com/Headlesser/oddestdocumentation">Organized and updated coherent design documentation which can be viewed here</a></li>

						<ul style="display:table;">
							<li><b>An example of my work on the project</b> involved helping the team overcome the problems we had during development with iterating on player feedback and cutting things</li> 
								<ul>
									<li>Sailing was not fun, controls were confusing</li>
									<li>Not enough points of interest or choices to keep player attention for very long</li>
									<li>Combat system was a constant problem, felt clunky, extraneous, and distracted from the strong visuals</li>
									<li>Team had trouble figuring out what was feasible given available resources</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Actions I took:</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Evaluated team technical competency, available time, and other tasks to determine what was out of scope</li>
									<li>Communicated cuts with producer, design, and programming teams at weekly meetings</li>
									<li>Moved away from wide-open map with multiple goals, instead helped design obstacle course layout with the final goal at the center of the map (lighthouse)</li>
									<li>Adjusted behavior of monsters to be more telegraphed so the player could understand their movements</li>
									<li>Made boat movement control less like a simulation</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Results:</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Better represented the experience of 'being pursued' we wanted to accomplish</li>
									<li>Player wasn't completely lost sailing without any direction</li>
									<li>Put greater emphasis on our strong visual aesthetic</li>
									<li>Reduced overall scope</li>
								</ul>
						</ul>	
							<!--<p>This created the core experience of 'being pursued' that we wanted to accomplish, where the player wasn't completely lost sailing around with little to no direction, and also provided players with a feeling of anxiety when, say, a monster is patrolling around the corner and they must slip past at the correct moment to continue without being seen, or risk being chased down. Cutting combat proved to be the correct choice as it reduced scope cosiderably and put a larger focus on our strong visual aesthetic.</p>-->
