							<p><b>OddestSea</b> is currently being developed by a team of 11 members. My primary role on the team is as the technical director, but includes
							other areas of design and programming. Some of my work includes prototyping and scripting mechanics in accordance with the core vision,
							detecting design flaws and making adjustments, and helping team members to communicate ideas and concerns with one another.</p>
							<p>Project began in August 2018 and is currently in ongoing development. Game has an expected release in March 2020.</p>
							<p><b>My contribution to OddestSea:</b></p>
								<ul style="display:table;">
									<li>Designed and implemented satisfying boat and camera movement</li> 
										<ul>
											<li>Proved to be an ongoing problem throughout development</li> 
											<li>Frequent iteration after repeated collection of playtest data</li>
											<li>Finished with a much smoother and enjoyable experience</li>
										</ul>
									<li><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/oddestseagame/devblog?authuser=0">Managed disputes and facilitated clear communications between design and programming teams, of which a write-up can be found here</a></li>
										<ul>
											<li>Miscommunication often caused serious problems in regards to task descriptions</li>
											<li>Lack of understanding led to misconceptions about expected deliverables and created a strained, unfriendly atmosphere</li>
											<li>Assisting team members in voicing their confusion with tasks or tools helped relieve personal tensions and clarify sprint goals</li>
										</ul>
									<li><a href="https://github.com/rockretep/oddestsea/wiki">Organized and updated coherent design documentation which can be viewed here</a></li>

							<p><b>One of the features I am most proud</b> of working on is the atmospheric design of 'a person being pursued', which both enhances the sailing experience beyond simply moving from landmark to landmark,
									as well as provides the player with unobtrusive feedback that keeps the experience free of elements that may distract from the strong and enriching atmosphere of the game.
									Originally, we had begun production with UI (health bar, compass, etc) that would be present on the game screen, as well as various mechanics (flare gun, combat, etc) that would require the
									player to multitask between sailing and other actions. We found this design to be debilitating early on, as players and critics frequently complained about the controls when it came to switching between
									sailing and other tools, as well as the UI in that it distracted from the engaging dark atmosphere of the game.</p>
							<p>Gradually we made changes to this system, first by removing any on-screen
									graphics in favor of a diegetic UI design, and then any 'tool' mechanics
									that required the player to do something other than sail, and replaced them with obstacles or areas of interest that could be interacted with simply by sailing to them. This change served
									to help expand upon the atmosphere of the game as our design now hinged on creating mechanics that enhanced the act of sailing itself rather than cluttering it. Additionally, this helped
									reduce the scope of the project significantly.</p>
