									<center><h2>Game Designer & Programmer</h2></center>
									<center><p>
									My name is <b>Emilie Holtz</b>. I am an aspiring woman in technology with a focus in <b><font color=#DB7093>Game Design</font>, <font color=#DDA0DD>Game Development</font>, <font color=#3CB371>Project Management</font>, and <font color=#7B68EE>Programming</font></b>. 
									As an enthusiast and creative professional, I am always exceedingly eager to meet new people and collaborate with others of all disciplines to create new and inventive experiences.
									What makes me <b>incandescently passionate</b> about games is the opportunity to work and have fun with a conglomerate of amazing creative professionals, and to forge interwoven and engaging ideas.
									Every project I have worked on has been a grand experience, and I hope to continue extending my skills in programming and technical art as a woman in games.

											<h3>OddestSea</h3>
											<p>
											A rogue-like sailing game where you take on the role of a courier responsible for delivering souls across a dark, archipelago strewn sea in order to gain your freedom. 
											Ultimate team goal is to have a fully functional, polished and shipped game to release on the PC market. 
											Prototyping in-depth sailing mechanics and essential design aspects are currently in progress. 
											Our main concern right now is testing whether or not sailing is 'fun', and how to set up sailing controls to enhance the player's experience. 
											Expected completion of the project is around Spring 2020.

											<h3>The Ripper</h3>
											<p>
											A 2D puzzle game inspired by the infamous 19th century serial killer, Jack the Ripper, and key police figure, Inspector Frederick Abberline.â€‹ 
											My initial goal was to see how deep of an experience could be done using only the free version of Construct 3.<br>
											Features:<br> 

											Unique NPCS with array-oriented dialogue<br>
											Dynamic UI integration of collectible clues<br>
											Dynamic soundtrack that changes in response to player progression<br>

											<h3>Affinity</h3>
											<p>
											An arcade-style local multiplayer fighting game where players battle in a fast-paced neon environment. 
											Ultimate project goal was to combine three individual prototypes created by each team member into one cohesive, unified game.<br>
											Features:<br> 

											Retro neon aesthetic<br>
											Rapid and fast-paced matches<br>
											2 player controller scheme with p1 mouse and keyboard, and p2 XBox 1 gamepad.<br>

											<h3>Stratagem</h3>
											<p>
											I wanted to make a 2D puzzle game based off of a personal independent project about a lawyer who must save his unfortunate older brother from madness. 
											My goal is to create a short, finished and original game with my roommate Gabrielle Benninghoff, who serves as the game artist. 
											Our current design goal is to complete five unique puzzles, each related to the theme of 'madness'.
