										A 3D roguelite where the player explores the Oddest Sea, monster-infested world where you must rescue the the sea and its citizens by 
										restoring light the dilapidated lighthouses and driving the beasts away. 
										Project began in August 2018 and is currently in ongoing development with a small team of 6 people. 
										Our current design focus right now is how to perfect the 'Player vs Sea' experience, such as designing the upgrade system, adjusting sailing movement, and prototyping open-sea combat.
										Expected release in 2020 for the PC platform.
										</p>
										My Role:
											<li>Designing core mechanics and complex systems such as moment-to-moment gameplay, upgrade systems, and sailing</li>
											<li>Collaborating with programmers so mechanics do not clash with thematic design to deliver a good user experience of sailing and rescuing</li>
											<li>Organizing comprehensive design document notes, meetings, and sprint tasks to keep firm deadlines and establish clarity</li>
											<li>Promptly addressing group conflicts and concerns in order to keep a strong shared vision and improve morale</li>
											<li>Programming gameplay mechanics such as ammunition, weapons, monster AI, and obstacles</li>

										<h3></h3>

										A 2D puzzle game inspired by the infamous 19th century Jack the Ripper murders where the player plays as Inspector Abberline, and must figure out which NPC is an accomplice to the murderer in order to catch Jack once and for all.
										This was a solo project where I wanted to focus on familiarizing myself with the art and sound asset production pipeline through new software in the form of Piskel and Reason​. 
										My goal was to create a puzzle game involving an NPC-based dialogue system using only the free version of Construct 3. Some design difficulties I ran into included how to
										display held clues to the player and how to provide a sense of progression. I solved these problems by desining a diegetic UI and layered music track to add more instruments with each clue found.
										Project was finished in approximately 2 months.</p>
										My Role:
											<li>Designed puzzle system and wrote all narrative dialogue</li>
											<li>Designed a diegetic UI to enhance the player experience of playing as a detective and finding clues</li>
											<li>Created all art assets, sound effects and music tracks</li>
											<li>Programmed array-based dialogue system</li>
										</ul>
