							I suggested a new upgrade system centered around buoys, which are locations that must be upgraded themselves before the player can purchase better modifications
									for their ship. The player can then allocate these souls to different sections of their ship, up to the max capacity their upgrades currently allow, in
									order to provide power to these different sections. This provides the player with meaningful decisions on how they want to 'build' their ship,
									how they should manage resources, and how they should allocate their stats at any given time.-->

									<p>A 3D sailing game where monsters are in constant pursuit and the player's only hope of survival is to reach the dormant lighthouses scattered throughout a dark and deadly sea.</p>
									<p>I work as a designer who provides technical support when needed, such as developing rapid prototypes to test new mechanics.
									Some of my primary work includes crafting and balancing elements and mechanics in accordance to the game vision and core themes, as well
									as detecting design flaws and making adjustments so all aspects of the experience fall in accordance to our core design pillars.
									I am focused mainly on systems design but I collaborate closely with all members of the development pipeline to discuss and review content, sprint plans, and cultivate a healthy collaborative environment.</p>
									<!--<p>We have had design difficulties throughout development when it came to how we should deliver an explorational sailing experience while also providing meaningful choices and interactions for the player.
									For example, originally our system involved the player needing to find a single mirror to return to a lighthouse, in which they would receive one upgrade as a reward. 
									We found this to be not very engaging with other mechanics or some of our core themes. To fix this, we removed mirrors and replaced them with a new functionality for souls-- wherein enough must be collected in order to power a single lighthouse.
									This way, the player can choose where they want to sail to and which resource deposits they want to attempt to gather at any given time. For example, the player may come across a shipwreck filled with souls, but it is guarded by a monster, 
									or they find another shipwreck elsewhere that is less protected and can be easily reached.
									<p>Another problem we encountered was how to further enhance the mechanic of sailing without drastically increasing scope with more unique 'tools' or mechanics. Since sailing is what
									the player will be doing the majority of the time, we wanted to put an emphasis on environmental and monster interactions that directly affect sailing or how the player should sail at any given time. 
									To fix this, we decided to implement a system of 'natural phenomena', or various natural obstacles that directly hinder (or help) the player's ship in some way, such as seaweed that will slow the boat down, or wind pockets that
									can provide a life-saving boost of speed. The same design philosophy also went towards the monster designs such as the Lamprey, which will attach to the player's ship like a leech and cause damage over time, unless the player
									sails through seaweed to brush the monster off. This way, the mechanic of sailing itself is more complex and requires the player to think more about how they should approach an obstacle and plan out the best strategy.-->
									
									<p>Project began in August 2018 and is currently in ongoing development with a team of 13. Expected release on Steam Spring 2020.</p>

									<div class="col-3"><span class="image left"><img src="images/ripper.gif" alt="" /></span></div>
									<p>A 2D dialogue-based puzzle game based on the infamous 19th century serial killer Jack the Ripper and historical figure Inspector Frederick Abberline. The police are hot on the trail of the most famous criminal of the century, but the player must locate Jack's accomplice before they can take him down once and for all.</p>
									<p>This game was a small solo project to both familiarize myself with various development pipelines, and create a fun little experience based off of one of my favorite historical periods.</p>
									<p>Some design difficulties I ran into included how to
										display held clues to the player and how to provide a sense of progression. I solved these problems by designing a diegetic UI and layered music track to add more instruments with each clue found.
										Project was finished in approximately 2 months.</p>
										
									<p>My contribution to The Ripper: </p>
										<ul>
											<li>Designed the puzzle and array-based dialogue system</li>
											<li>Designed a diegetic UI to enhance the player experience of playing as a clever detective</li>
											<li>Created all art assets, sound & music, and dialogue</li>

									<p>A 3D escape room experience where the player takes on the role of a spy who breaks into a futuristic IT company and must steal private information to reach the company vault.</p>
									<p>I am currently working as a contracted designer for the Indiana University IT department to create a game geared towards engaging players with the idea of how people
									store personal data, and how others might take advantage of poor information security habits. This would include things such as passwords, passphrases, authentication methods, and other personal
									information that may be used to gain access to otherwise private or classified material.</p>
									<p>I work closely with contract supervisors and my contract partner (programmer) to make sure all aspects of the design fall within institution credentials.
									My design work thus far has primarily been focused on puzzle and level design.</p>
									<p>Above all, I want to create a fun experience focused on keeping players engaged with the puzzle solving involved rather than creating
									a purely educational simulator, as I believe this is crucial for keeping the experience both memorable, but also enjoyable. However, I do not want to undermine the educational aspects of gameplay,
									as these too are crucial for delivering the message we want players to walk away with-- that is, to make players feel aware of their own security practices and how they might change them.</p>
									<!--<p>As such, we have come up with a unique philosophy to drive all of our puzzle design decisions, wherein the solutions to these puzzles will all be found through the 'educational aspect'
									of the game, while the 'physical' way the player inputs the solution will be done through environmental interactions using
									the various tools they have available. For example, the player begins the game with a shrink ray that only works on green objects. The player finds the exit blocked by a heavy red crate they cannot move. They find an office with a phone that does not have a passcode lock and 
									are easily able to steal the information on the phone. As a result, they figure out
									the keycode to a supply closet. In the supply closet is a bucket of green paint, which they can use to turn the red crate into a green crate, and then shrink it to unblock the exit.</p>-->
									
									<p>My contribution to "Passwords, Please": </p>
										<ul>
											<li>Designing a linear escape room experience with non-linear branches to create a layer of logical depth</li>
											<li>Designing and developing prototypes for various minor mechanics, tools, and demos such as tutorial levels, hint indicators, etc.</li>
											<li>Organizing and updating clear and concise game documentation</li>
											<li>Communicating regularly with contractors and team members to plan out tasks and confirm design directions</li>
										</ul>
