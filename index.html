									<!--The police are hot on the trail of the most famous criminal of the century, but the player must locate Jack's accomplice before they can take him down once and for all.-->
									<p>A 2D dialogue-based puzzle game based on the infamous 19th century serial killer Jack the Ripper and historical figure Inspector Frederick Abberline.</p>
									<p>This game was a small solo project to both familiarize myself with various development pipelines and create a short puzzle experience.</p>
									<p>Some design difficulties I ran into included how to
										display held clues to the player and how to provide a sense of progression. I solved these problems by designing a diegetic UI and layered music track to add more instruments with each clue found.
										Project was finished in approximately 1 month.</p>
										
									<p>My contribution to The Ripper: </p>
										<ul>
											<li>Designed the puzzle and array-based dialogue system</li>
											<li>Designed a diegetic UI to enhance the player experience of playing as a clever detective</li>
											<li>Created all art assets, sound & music, and dialogue</li>
										</ul>

									<h2 class="major">"Passwords, Please" | January 2019 - Ongoing | Designer</h2>

									<p>A 3D escape room experience where the player takes on the role of a spy who breaks into a futuristic IT company and must steal private information to reach the company vault.</p>
									<p>I am currently working as a contracted designer for the Indiana University IT department to create a game geared towards engaging players with the idea of how people
									store personal data, and how others might take advantage of poor information security habits. This would include things such as passwords, passphrases, authentication methods, and other personal
									information that may be used to gain access to otherwise private or classified material.</p>
									<p>I work closely with contract supervisors and my contract partner (programmer) to make sure all aspects of the design fall within institution credentials.
									My design work thus far has primarily been focused on puzzle and level design.</p>
									<p>Above all, I want to create a fun experience focused on keeping players engaged with the puzzle solving involved rather than creating
									a purely educational simulator, as I believe this is crucial for keeping the experience both memorable, but also enjoyable. However, I do not want to undermine the educational aspects of gameplay,
									as these too are crucial for delivering the message we want players to walk away with-- that is, to make players feel aware of their own security practices and how they might change them.</p>
									<!--<p>As such, we have come up with a unique philosophy to drive all of our puzzle design decisions, wherein the solutions to these puzzles will all be found through the 'educational aspect'
									of the game, while the 'physical' way the player inputs the solution will be done through environmental interactions using
									the various tools they have available. For example, the player begins the game with a shrink ray that only works on green objects. The player finds the exit blocked by a heavy red crate they cannot move. They find an office with a phone that does not have a passcode lock and 
									are easily able to steal the information on the phone. As a result, they figure out
									the keycode to a supply closet. In the supply closet is a bucket of green paint, which they can use to turn the red crate into a green crate, and then shrink it to unblock the exit.</p>-->
									
									<p>My contribution to "Passwords, Please": </p>
										<ul>
											<li>Designing a linear escape room experience with non-linear branches to create a layer of logical depth</li>
											<li>Designing and developing prototypes for various minor mechanics, tools, and demos such as tutorial levels, hint indicators, etc.</li>
											<li>Organizing and updating clear and concise game documentation</li>
											<li>Communicating regularly with contractors and team members to plan out tasks and confirm design directions</li>
										</ul>
