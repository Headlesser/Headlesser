									My name is <b>Emilie Holtz</b>. I am an aspiring woman in technology with a focus in <b><font color=#DB7093>Game Design</font>, <font color=#DDA0DD>Technical Art</font>, and <font color=#7B68EE>Programming</font></b>. 
									As an enthusiast and creative professional, I am always exceedingly eager to meet new people and collaborate with others of all disciplines to create new and inventive experiences.
									What makes me <b>incandescently passionate</b> about games is the opportunity to work and have fun with a conglomerate of amazing creative professionals and to forge engaging ideas into awesome interwoven experiences.
									Every project I have worked on has been a grand experience, and I hope to continue extending my skills in programming and technical art as a woman in games.
