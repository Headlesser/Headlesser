									<h1 class="major">OddestSea</h1>
									<div class="col-3"><span class="image left"><img src="images/boatgif.gif" alt="" /></span></div>
									<p>A 3D sailing game with roguelike elements where the player explores a monster-infested purgatory and must ferry souls to lighthouses in order to escape an unending cycle of death.</p>
									<p>I work as a designer who can provide technical support when needed, such as developing rapid prototypes to test new mechanics.
									I am focused mainly on systems design but I collaborate closely with all aspects of the development pipeline.</p>
									<p>We had design difficulties in early development when it came to how we should provide meaningful choices and progression to the player.
									Originally our system involved the player needing to find a single mirror to return to a lighthouse, in which they would receive one upgrade as a reward. 
									We found this to be out of place and not very engaging with other mechanics. To fix this, we removed mirrors and replaced them with a new functionality for souls.
									I suggested a new upgrade system centered around buoys, which are locations that must be upgraded themselves before the player can purchase better modifications
									for their ship. The player can then allocate these souls to different sections of their ship, up to the max capacity their upgrades currently allow, in
									order to provide power to these different sections. This provides the player with meaningful decisions on how they want to 'build' their ship,
									how they should manage resources, and how they should allocate their stats at any given time.
									<p>Project began in August 2018 and is currently in ongoing development with a team of 10. Expected release on Steam Spring 2020.</p>
									<p>My contribution to OddestSea: </p>
										<ul>
											<li>Designing many aspects of the game including gameplay, systems, environments, upgrades, etc.</li>
											<li>I worked closely with programmers to iterate on gameplay features; movement, cameras, flare, player stats, & other mechanics.</li>
											<li>Rapidly developing and implementing essential UI and mechanics for iterative playtesting and adjustments.</li>
											<li>Addressing design flaws and collaborating with team members to prevent conflicts and confusion down the pipeline.</li>
											<li>Organizing clear design documentation and core vision to all members of the team.</li>

									<h1 class="major">The Ripper</h1>
									<div class="col-3"><span class="image left"><img src="images/ripper.gif" alt="" /></span></div>
									<p>A 2D dialogue-based puzzle game based on the infamous 19th century serial killer Jack the Ripper and historical figure Inspector Frederick Abberline. The police are hot on the trail of the most famous criminal of the century, but the player must locate Jack's accomplice before they can take him down once and for all.</p>
									<p>This game was a small solo project to both familiarize myself with various development pipelines, and create a fun little experience based off of one of my favorite historical periods.</p>
									<p>Some design difficulties I ran into included how to
										display held clues to the player and how to provide a sense of progression. I solved these problems by designing a diegetic UI and layered music track to add more instruments with each clue found.
										Project was finished in approximately 2 months.</p>
										
									<p>My contribution to The Ripper: </p>
										<ul>
											<li>Designed the puzzle and array-based dialogue system</li>
											<li>Designed a diegetic UI to enhance the player experience of playing as a clever detective</li>
											<li>Created all art assets, sound & music, and dialogue</li>

									<div class="col-3"><span class="image left"><img src="images/levelmap.png" alt="" /></span></div>
									<p>A 3D escape room experience where the player takes on the roll of a spy broken into an office building and must steal private information to reach the company vault.</p>
									<p>I am currently working as a contracted designer for the Indiana University IT department to create a game geared towards engaging players with the idea of how people
									store personal data, and how others might take advantage of poor information security habits. This would include things such as passwords, passphrases, and other personal
									information that may be used to gain access to otherwise private material.</p>
									<p>I work closely with contract supervisors and my contract partner (programmer) to make sure all aspects of the design fall within institution credentials.
									My design work thus far has primarily been focused on puzzle and level design.</p>
									<p>Above all, I want to create a fun experience focused on keeping players engaged with the puzzle solving involved rather than creating
									a purely educational simulator, as I believe this is crucial for keeping the experience both memorable, but also enjoyable</p>
									
									<p>My contribution to "Passwords, Please": </p>
										<ul>
											<li>Designing a linear escape room puzzle with non-linear branches to create a layer of logical depth</li>
											<li>Designing and developing quick prototypes for various minor mechanics and tools such as a blacklight, cipher wheels, etc.</li>
											<li>Organizing and updating clear and concise game documentation</li>
										</ul>
