							<p><b>Enter the Dungeon</b> is a short text adventure game made during the COVID-19 pandemic</p>
							<p>Project began in February 2020 and was finished April 2020. The game can be viewed on itch.io<a href="https://headlesser.itch.io/enter-the-dungeon">here</a></p>

							<p><b>One of the problems I had during development was</b> how to
							display held clues to the player and how to provide a sense of progression, which players said was very unclear during playtesting. I solved these problems by designing a diegetic UI and layered music track to add more instruments with each clue found as a way to audibly and visibly communicate the effects of the player's actions.</p>
							<p>
							This created a situation where the player could audibly hear their progression. That is, with each clue found, the soundtrack becomes more complex until the entire song has been 'revealed' whenever the player has successfully completed a task. The diegetic UI cut down on having to create
							an extensive amount of menu assets given the limitations of Construct 3 Free Edition, and also made it clearer to the player what items they had on their person at any given time.</p>
