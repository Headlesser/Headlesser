							<h1 class="major">Passwords, Please</h1>
							<p><b>Passwords, Please</b> is part of a campaign to create an educational puzzle game geared towards engaging players with ideas of how people
							store personal data and how others might take advantage of poor information security habits.</p>
							
							<p>Project began in March 2019 and is currently in ongoing development with a planned release by the university May 1, 2020.</p>
							<ul style="display:table;">
								<li><b>Skills Acquired</b></li>
									<ul>
										<li>Working with institution contractors to create a product with requested goals and requirements
										<li>
										<li>Desiging and developing educational puzzles and gameplay</li>
										<li>Providing consultment to contractors on game design practices and methodology</li>

									</ul>

							<p><b>My contribution to Passwords, Please:</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li><a href="https://github.com/Headlesser/PasswordsPleasev2/wiki">Organized and updated clear and concise documentation, which can be found here</a></li>
									<li>Developed a puzzle design method based off of materials from the Indiana University IT escape room experience</li>
									<li>Developed prototypes and framework for player/camera movement and click interactions</li>
									<li>Communicating regularly with contractors and team members to discuss design space, filter ideas and make concrete decisions</li>

							<p><b>One of the features I am most proud</b> of working on is the point-and-click design paired with a lock-and-key puzzle structure, which
							keeps the player primarily focused on the puzzle solving and creates a more user-friendly experience for our audience. Passwords, Please was originally a first-person platformer that focused on having the player manipulate the environment to access
							new areas. After analysis of playtesting data, I found that our users were beginning to lose sight of the game's intended purpose and gameplay design became
							increasingly difficult due to confusion on what the goal was. Players would focus not on the themes or topics expressed by the puzzle, but rather unnecessary
							aspects such as how to move with the keyboard/mouse, or have a strong desire to ignore the puzzle completely and try clicking on every irrelevant object.</p>
							<p>To address this problem, I created a new prototype focused only on clicking (akin to 2D flash games), where every action
							the player had could be accomplished with only one button. This served to reduce the confusion involving controls, reduce the technical complexity our old design originally had, as well as bring
							the design focus back on the message the puzzles are trying to convey- that being how users can recognize and understand poor security habits.</p>
