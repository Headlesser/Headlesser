							<h1 class="major">Passwords, Please</h1>
							<p><b>Passwords, Please</b> is currently in development by a team of 3 members. My primary role on the team is as a designer and programmer. This project is part of a campaign to create an educational puzzle game geared towards engaging players with ideas of how people
							store personal data and how others might take advantage of poor information security habits. This would include things such as passwords, passphrases, authentication methods, and other personal
							information that may be used to gain access to otherwise private or classified material.</p>
							
							<p>Project began in January 2019 and is currently in ongoing development.</p>
							<p><b>My contribution to "Passwords, Please":</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Communicating regularly with contractors and team members to discuss design space, filter ideas and make concrete decisions</li>
									<li>Managing tasks and deadlines to uphold a self-motivating work ethic and keep team members on schedule</li>
									<li>Designing an educational escape-room experience using realistic security habits to create a sense of relatability</li>
									<li>Designing and developing prototypes for various mechanics and demos such as tutorial levels, hint indicators, etc</li>
									<li>Organizing and updating clear and concise documentation</li>
								</ul>

							<!-- <p><b>The features I am most proud</b> of working on is the two-part system where the player must willingly search for and take advantage of poor security habits to power their Telekinesis Lens, which keeps their minds focused on the
							topic space we want to convey all throughout gameplay. For clarification, the Telekinesis Lens is a tool the player uses that can move objects within certain qualifications.
							It was incredibly difficult to find some way to keep the educational aspect of the game at the forefront without completely
							'hand-holding' the player or sacrificing the ability to use their own logical reasoning. Thus, we decided to design a format where, to both collect 'keys' and use the Telekinesis Lens,
							the player must apply their knowledge of both good/poor security protocols the game explains and use that knowledge to locate evidence of these habits. Finding an example of a good security habit powers the Telekinesis Lens. For example, in the level that highlights lessons on 'password complexity',
							the player enters an area with a locked closet, an unlocked office, and the exit which is currently blocked by a large red object. Their Telekinesis Lens, unfortunately, only works on <b>green</b> objects. The player enters administrator's office and finds various papers on the desk.
							Inside of a folder on the desk, the administrator has written down all of their passwords (as people are often caught doing, especially with complex passwords of random alphanumeric characters). By recognizing this
							common way of storing passwords, the player is able to locate the pin needed to unlock the supply closet. Inside the supply closet is a bucket of green paint. The player can use
							their Telekinesis Lens to use the paint and turn the red object into a green object, thus allow them to move it out of the way.</p> 
							I wanted to help create a fun experience focused on keeping players engaged with the puzzle solving rather than simply creating
							an online lesson, as I believe the added interactivity with the content can keep the experience both memorable, but also more enjoyable than a lecture. 
							Above all, we wanted to make players feel aware of their own security practices and how they can change them, so I wanted to take the game down the path of an 'inner monologue', where
							the player character will think to themselves via on-screen text about the various bad habits or clumsy security protocols practiced according to the evidence the player finds in game.
							This creates a careful balance between making the player aware of their own practices, in addition to informing them to the weaknesses of certain common security methods and how
							they can change their ways to make their own data as safe as possible.-->
							<p><b>The features I am most proud</b> of working on is the point-and-click design paired with a lock-and-key puzzle structure, which
							keeps the player primarily focused on the puzzle solving and creates a more user-friendly experience for our target audience. Initially,
							"Passwords, Please" was designed a first-person platformer that focused on having the player manipulate the environment through the guise of puzzles to access
							new areas. After analysis of playtesting data and scope, I found that our users were beginning to lose sight of the game's intended purpose and gameplay design became
							increasingly difficult due expressed confusion by players. Players would focus not on the themes or topics expressed by the puzzle, but rather unnecessary
							aspects such as how to move with the keyboard/mouse, or have a strong desire to ignore the puzzle completely and try clicking on every irrelevant object.</p>
							<p>It was clear then that our current design was not working towards the focused experience we wanted to create and players were getting
							easily distracted with a lack of feedback. To address this problem, I created a new prototype focused only on clicking (akin to 2D flash games), where every action
							the player had could be accomplished with only one button. This served to reduce the confusion involving controls, as well as bring
							the design focus back on the message the puzzles are trying to convey-- that being how users can recognize and understand poor security habits.</p>
