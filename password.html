							<p><b>Passwords, Please</b> is currently in development by a team of 3 members. My primary role on the team is as a designer and programmer. This project is part of a campaign to create an educational puzzle game geared towards engaging players with ideas of how people
							store personal data and how others might take advantage of poor information security habits.</p>
							
							<p>Project began in January 2019 and is currently in ongoing development.</p>
							<p><b>My contribution to Passwords, Please:</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Communicating regularly with contractors and team members to discuss design space, filter ideas and make concrete decisions</li>
									<li>Managing tasks and deadlines to uphold a self-motivating work ethic and keep team members on schedule</li>
									<li>Designing an educational puzzle experience using realistic security habits to create a sense of relatability</li>
									<li>Developing prototypes for various mechanics and structures such as movement, click interactions, etc</li>
									<li>Organizing and updating clear and concise documentation</li>
								</ul>

							<p><b>One of the features I am most proud</b> of working on is the point-and-click design paired with a lock-and-key puzzle structure, which
							keeps the player primarily focused on the puzzle solving and creates a more user-friendly experience for our audience. Initially,
							"Passwords, Please" was designed a first-person platformer that focused on having the player manipulate the environment through the guise of puzzles to access
							new areas. After analysis of playtesting data and scope, I found that our users were beginning to lose sight of the game's intended purpose and gameplay design became
							increasingly difficult due to expressed confusion by players. Players would focus not on the themes or topics expressed by the puzzle, but rather unnecessary
							aspects such as how to move with the keyboard/mouse, or have a strong desire to ignore the puzzle completely and try clicking on every irrelevant object.</p>
							<p>It was clear then that our current design was not working towards the focused experience we wanted to create and players were getting
							easily distracted with a lack of feedback. To address this problem, I created a new prototype focused only on clicking (akin to 2D flash games), where every action
							the player had could be accomplished with only one button. This served to reduce the confusion involving controls, as well as bring
							the design focus back on the message the puzzles are trying to convey-- that being how users can recognize and understand poor security habits.</p>
