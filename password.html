							<h1 class="major">Passwords, Please</h1>
							<p><b>Passwords, Please</b> is part of a campaign to create an educational puzzle game geared towards engaging players with ideas of how people
							store personal data and how others might take advantage of poor information security habits.
							Project began in March 2019 and is currently in ongoing development with a planned release by the university May 1, 2020.</p>
							<ul style="display:table;">
								<li><b>Skills Acquired</b></li>
									<ul>
										<li>Working with institution contractors to create a product with requested goals and requirements</li>
										<li>Desiging and developing educational puzzles and gameplay</li>
										<li>Providing consultment to contractors on game design practices and methodology</li>

									</ul>
							</ul>
							<p><b>My contribution to Passwords, Please:</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li><a href="https://github.com/Headlesser/PasswordsPleasev2/wiki">Organized and updated clear and concise documentation, which can be found here</a></li>
									<li>Developed a puzzle design method based off of materials from the Indiana University IT escape room experience</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Developing puzzles without a framework or method was incredibly difficult</li>
											<li>Engaged and examined materials from an IT escape room workshop suggested by contractors</li>
											<li>Used the successful aspects of the escape room workshop to create a 'lock-and-key' puzzle design method</li>
											<li>Following this method made the design pipeline perform smoother</li>
										</ul>
									<li>Communicating regularly with contractors and team members to discuss design space, filter ideas and make concrete decisions</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Development began with only two people working on the project</li>
											<li>Making design choices and managing disagreements became extremely difficult when there was no tie-breaker</li>
											<li>Project suffered due to slowed development and unclear vision</li>
											<li>Consulted with contractors to expand the team to three people</li>
											<li>Odd number of members allowed for easier decision making and offered a fresh perspective on design</li>

							<li><b>Some of my work on the project</b> involved creating a method to design and implement puzzles in a way that emphasized the educational experience
								<ul>
									<li>Project was initially designed as a first-person platformer</li>
									<li>Focus put on player manipulating environment to access new areas</li>
									<li>Playtest analysis showed players losing sign of game's intended educational purpose</li>
									<li>Players would hyper focus on clicking every irrelevant object or how to move around the world instead of the educational content</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Process:</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Parsed through player feedback to determine what aspects of gameplay were most irrelevant (keyboard movement, jumping)</li>
									<li>Suggested to pivot away from a first-person platformer in favor of a point-and-click structure</li>
									<li>Created a completely new prototype following this suggestion where clicking was the player's only means of moving/interacting</li>
									<li>Moved puzzle design methodology towards an escape room-like experience</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Results:</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Players responed positively to simpler controls and spend less time idling</li>
									<li>Point-and-click structure paired extremely well with our lock-and-key puzzle design</li>
									<li>Reduced technical complexity of to movement and object interaction</li>
									<li>Provided some greatly needed constraints on level and puzzle design in that there is only one room with a singular input action (clicking)</li>
									<li>Helped bring player focus back onto the educational message of the puzzles themselves rather than distracting mechanics or controls</li>
								</ul>
						</ul>	
							<!--involved the creation of the point-and-click design paired with a lock-and-key puzzle structure, which
							keeps the player primarily focused on the puzzle solving and creates a more user-friendly experience for our audience. Passwords, Please was originally a first-person platformer that focused on having the player manipulate the environment to access
							new areas. After analysis of playtesting data, I found that our users were beginning to lose sight of the game's intended purpose and gameplay design became
							increasingly difficult due to confusion on what the goal was. Players would focus not on the themes or topics expressed by the puzzle, but rather unnecessary
							aspects such as how to move with the keyboard/mouse, or have a strong desire to ignore the puzzle completely and try clicking on every irrelevant object.</p>
							<p>To address this problem, I created a new prototype focused only on clicking (akin to 2D flash games), where every action
							the player had could be accomplished with only one button. This served to reduce the confusion involving controls, reduce the technical complexity our old design originally had, as well as bring
							the design focus back on the message the puzzles are trying to convey- that being how users can recognize and understand poor security habits.</p>
